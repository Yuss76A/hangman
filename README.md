# Hangman 
Hangman is a Python-based terminal game that operates within the Code Institute's simulated terminal environment and is hosted on Heroku.

In this game, players will be challenged to figure out a randomly chosen word. They can make guesses by typing individual letters or entire words. The aim is to correctly guess the word and save the character from being hanged before running out of attempts.

## How to play
Initially, players will be prompted to enter their name, which will start the game.

A word related to espionage will be randomly selected, with each letter represented by an **_** symbol, revealing the total number of letters in the word.

Players will then be asked to enter a letter or attempt to guess the entire word.

Guesses must consist of letters from the English alphabet. Word guesses must match the length of the given word and only include English alphabet characters.

Correct letter guesses will replace the corresponding **_** symbols with the correct letters. For each incorrect guess, whether a letter or a whole word, the player will lose a life, bringing the character one step closer to being captured and hanged.

Upon successfully identifying the word, players will receive a congratulatory message and an option to play again.

If players run out of lives, the character will, unfortunately, be captured and hanged. A message of commiseration will be presented, along with an opportunity to try again.

Players will also be reminded of any letters they have already guessed, prompting them to guess again without losing a life for repeated guesses.
