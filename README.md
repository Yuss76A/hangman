# Hangman 
Hangman is a Python-based terminal game that operates within the Code Institute's simulated terminal environment and is hosted on Heroku.

In this game, players will be challenged to figure out a randomly chosen word. They can make guesses by typing individual letters or entire words. The aim is to correctly guess the word and save the character from being hanged before running out of attempts.
